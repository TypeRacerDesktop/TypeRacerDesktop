   The bald eagle, with its snowy-feathered head and white tail, is the proud national bird symbol of the United States yet the bird was nearly wiped out there. For many decades, bald eagles were hunted for sport and for the protection of fishing grounds. Pesticides like DDT also wreaked havoc on eagles and other birds. These chemicals collect in fish, which make up most of the eagles diet. They weaken the birds eggshells and severely limited their ability to reproduce. Since DDT use was heavily restricted in 1972, eagle numbers have rebounded significantly and have been aided by reintroduction programs. The result is a wildlife success story the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has upgraded the birds from endangered to threatened. Though their numbers have grown in much of their range, bald eagles remain most abundant in Alaska and Canada. These powerful birds of prey use their talons to fish, but they get many of their meals by scavenging carrion or stealing the kills of other animals.
