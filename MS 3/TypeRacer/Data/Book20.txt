   Because of the breadth of electronically perpetrated crimes and the depth to which an analysis of each type of crime can plume, the case study focus of this paper will be centered only on one of the most prominent form of crime that is relevant to both computer and cyber crime laws - Cyber-fraud and identity theft - through the act of what is commonly known as phishing and its progeny. The offence is also a useful case study as it is a universal offence which is capable of uniform treatment,  and that makes it a worthy subject for a good comparative study. Phishing is a term coined by the relatively new form of modus operandi by which scams are perpetrated through the Internet. It involves the theft of the identity of a target organisation for the purpose of stealing the identities of its users or customers without their knowledge or consent. This is done through the use of professional-looking, HTML-based e-mails that include company logos, font styles, colours, graphics, and other elements to successfully spoof the supposed sender - i.e. constituting fraudulent conduct. Most also contain a hyperlink to a web site, which is almost always an exact replica of the spoofed site, to lure users or consumers into a false sense of security and into relaying their personal information. The motive may be purely pecuniary but not always necessarily so. Also, the approach may be similar, but the modus operandi has since mutated and taken on many innovative forms.
