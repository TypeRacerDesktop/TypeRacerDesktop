There are more than 400 species of sharks in the world, and a few spend most of their time in freshwater. Although this may sound terrifying to those hitting rivers, lakes, and swimming holes to cool off in the summer heat, they pose little danger to people. When most scientists speak of river sharks, they refer to five known species of the Glyphis genus, although biologists think there could be other species lurking in the shadows. These river sharks live in India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Australia, though they are rarely seen and not well studied. Some are known from only a single specimen. All five species are threatened thanks to human development, pollution, and fishing. River sharks tends to have short, broad snouts and tiny eyes. They are thought to reach lengths up to around nine feet, although very few adults have been documented. River sharks tend to have broad fins and look a bit more fish like than some of the better known sharks.
